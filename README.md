# AAD-Basic-Template
Starter project for AAD learners. Rearranged to resemble Jim Wilson's Demo app

## Steps:

### 1. Open a terminal
#### On windows
 - Click the start menu.
 - Type in ```cmd``` & select the first result you see - "Command Prompt".

#### _Assuming you have Android Studio already installed_
### 2. On the terminal
  - Type ```cd AndroidStudioProjects```.
  - Hit Enter.
  
Now you're in the parent Directory of your Android Studio Projects

#### Note: _Assuming you have Git already installed on your machine_ and you must be connected to the internet from here on.

### 3. Clone this repository
  - Type ```git clone https://github.com/f0rx/AAD-Basic-Template.git```
  - Hit Enter.
  
  _Once cloning is done.._
### 4. Run Project on Android Studio
  - Launch Android Studio
  - Click ```Open an existing Android Studio project``` (Remember, you must have a stable internet connection)
  - ```Gradle build``` should have started, allow gradle to build files; it may take awhile.
  
  ....
  - If you don't see any running process at the bottom of your screen & you don't see any red squiggly lines or errors, then ```gradle sync``` completed successfully.
  ##### But we're not done yet...
  - Just to be certain that ```gradle sync``` was succesesfully,
    - Click the ```Hammer``` icon at the top of Android Studio - "Make Project".
    - Gradle build should start running again. Be patient please, we don't want to get any errors.
    
    Again, if after a while, you dont see any running process or errors, it means you're ready to Code.
    
  #### HURRAY!!
  #### KEEP LEARNING!
